### Resume Analysis: How Your Background Aligns with the Genpact Accounts Payable Role

First off, congrats on getting the invite—this is a solid opportunity, especially since Genpact emphasizes process-driven roles with a tech twist (AI, automation), and your Amazon experience shows you're no stranger to high-volume, SLA-bound operations in a global setup. I've reviewed your resume in detail. You're a B.Tech in Electrical & Electronics Engineering (not commerce, but that's not a hard barrier—focus on your functional skills), with ~5 years at Amazon (2020–present), split between HR Shared Services (payroll/leaves) and Product Compliance (appeals/audits). Key strengths: Data management (80+ cases/day), audits, escalations, root cause analysis (RCA), training, ERP tools (PeopleSoft, ADP, Salesforce), and process improvements (8+ ideas submitted, 100% quality score).

**Overall Fit Summary:**
- **Strengths/Matches (High Alignment: 70-80%):** Your HR Shared Services role screams transferable skills—payroll processing, invoice-like document reviews (e.g., EOB audits for 3500+ employees), reconciliations (e.g., Aged TT reports), escalations (60+ supports with RCA), and compliance (SOPs, audits). Tools like ADP Payroll Central overlap with ERP needs (SAP/Navision). Leadership (mentoring 3 PLs/5 TMs) fits their "independently perform tasks" vibe. US-focused experience (leaves/payroll for US employees) is a huge plus for night shifts.
- **Gaps (Moderate: Need to Bridge):** No direct Accounts Payable (AP) experience (e.g., 3-way match, PO/Non-PO invoices, TDS/GST). Your engineering degree isn't commerce, but highlight commerce-adjacent skills (analytics, Excel). No SAP/Blackline mentioned, but your HRIS proficiency (PeopleSoft/ADP) shows quick learning—lean on certifications like SAP ERP Essential Training.
- **Opportunities to Shine:** Frame your story as "HR ops specialist pivoting to finance ops" via shared themes: Accuracy in high-stakes processing, vendor-like interactions (e.g., seller appeals), and global compliance. Your achievements (top 5 in AES, RnR awards) prove you deliver under pressure.

| Your Resume Highlight | JD Requirement | How to Map It in Interview |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Managed 80 cases/day in payroll/leave data (PeopleSoft, ADP, Kronos) | Review/process invoices, resolve queries within SLA | "In HRSS, I processed 80+ daily payroll/leave records with 100% accuracy, mirroring invoice validation—ensuring data integrity via reconciliations and audits for 7000+ global employees." |
| EOB Audits, Aged TT reports, RCA on escalations (60+ supports) | Reconciliations, exception logs, RCA for aged/unapplied cash | "Handled root cause analysis for escalations and audited 3500+ EOBs, identifying errors and balancing records—similar to tracking invoice exceptions and vendor query resolutions." |
| Led CTK project (3000+ records), piloted EOB streamlining | Month-end closing, nonstandard J/Es (accruals, prepaids) | "Solely led a LOA conversion project processing 3000+ records, including accruals and audits—directly transferable to month-end reconciliations and accruals in R2R." |
| Training/mentoring new hires, SOP creation | Enforce compliance, maintain trackers/logs | "Created SOPs for EOB streamlining and mentored 8+ team members on processes, ensuring 100% adherence—ready to apply to AP compliance and exception tracking." |
| Tools: ADP, PeopleSoft, Salesforce; Cert: SAP ERP Essential | ERP (SAP/Navision/Blackline), invoice auditing | "Proficient in ADP/PeopleSoft for payroll processing; completed SAP ERP training—eager to adapt to SAP for PO/Non-PO workflows." |
| US Leave ops, STD/PAR benefits for 7000+ employees | US shifts, India AP nuances (TDS/GST basics) | "Managed US payroll/benefits for hourly/salaried staff, handling confidential data—aligned with night shifts and basic tax/compliance knowledge from audits." |

You're not a "commerce grad," but emphasize functional equivalence: "My engineering foundation + HR ops honed analytical skills equivalent to B.Com finance processing."

### Deep Dive into the Job Description: Understanding Accounts Payable (AP) at Genpact

This is a mega virtual drive for AP roles (part of Record to Report/Order to Cash streams), focused on Kolkata WFO, US night shifts (expect 6-7 PM IST start for US hours). It's entry-to-mid level (18 months–8 years exp.), screening for basics like invoice processing accuracy. Genpact's angle: Tech-heavy (AI for automation), so highlight your process innovation (e.g., Payroll Central 2.0 training).

#### Key Responsibilities Breakdown
The JD splits into AP core, Record to Report (R2R), and Cash Applications. It's operational—high volume, low creativity, but with compliance twists. Expect to handle 50-100 invoices/day initially.

1. **Core AP Processing (Your Strongest Transferable Area):**
   - **Review/Process Invoices & Payments:** Validate essentials (supplier details, PO #, date, bank info), post to ERP, release for payment. Includes resolutions (e.g., mismatches).
     - *3-Way Match/PO/Non-PO/GRN:* Compare Purchase Order (PO) + Goods Receipt Note (GRN) + Invoice for approval. PO = ordered items; Non-PO = no order (e.g., utilities); GRN = delivery confirmation.
     - *India-Specific:* Check Bill of Entry/packing list for imports; apply TDS (Tax Deducted at Source, e.g., 2% on professional services, 10% on contracts—know basics, not deep rates). GST: Intra-state (CGST+SGST, e.g., 18% total), Inter-state (IGST, e.g., 18%).
   - **Vendor Queries/SLA:** Resolve emails/tickets (e.g., "Why is my invoice on hold?") within 24-48 hrs. Follow up via calls/emails.
   - **Audits/Trackers:** Daily internal checks for balance; log exceptions (e.g., duplicate invoices) for RCA.
   - *Prep Tip:* Study basics via free YouTube (search "3-way match AP process"). Relate to your EOB audits: "Just like auditing employee docs for compliance."

2. **Record to Report (R2R) – Month-End Focus:**
   - **Closing/Reconciliations:** Balance accounts (Key: Bank/cash; Non-Key: Accruals). Post J/Es (Journal Entries): Standard (recurring like rent), Nonstandard (one-offs like prepaids/leases).
   - *Tools:* SAP/Blackline/HANA for postings; High Radius for cash.
   - *Prep Tip:* Your Aged TT reports and accruals in LOA = mini-R2R. Say: "Reconciled payroll data monthly, posting adjustments—similar to accrual J/Es."

3. **Cash Applications/Collections (Order to Cash – O2C):**
   - **Posting Payments:** Apply lockbox receipts (bank uploads) to customer accounts; resolve aged/unapplied (e.g., wrong account #).
   - **Collections:** Call/email delinquent payers for promises-to-pay (PTPs).
   - *Prep Tip:* Parallels your escalation management: "Resolved 60+ payroll escalations via RCA—ready for cash research and vendor follow-ups."

#### Qualifications Breakdown
- **Minimum:** Commerce grad (B.Com/BBA preferred—pivot with "My B.Tech + HR analytics = strong numerical foundation"). 18+ months exp. in AP/Invoice/ERP (use your 3+ years in processing). Excellent English (you've got this from Amazon comms).
- **Preferred:** India stats (TDS/GST basics—quick Google: TDS rates via incometaxindia.gov.in; GST via gst.gov.in). SAP exp. (your cert helps).
- **Why Genpact?** Stress their AI focus: "Excited to blend my process efficiency with your Gigafactory innovations, like automating audits."

### Crash Course: Breaking Down the Genpact Accounts Payable (AP) Job Description

No problem at all—since your background is in US payroll and HR ops (which is awesome for the processing and audit side), I'll treat this like a beginner-friendly tutorial. We'll go section by section through the JD, explaining every term in plain English, with real-world examples. I'll use analogies from your Amazon experience (e.g., treating invoices like payroll claims or seller appeals) to make it stick. No jargon overload—think of this as "AP 101 for HR Pros."

The role is basically about handling the "money out" side of a business: Paying vendors/suppliers accurately, on time, and compliantly, while spotting errors to avoid over/under-payments. It's high-volume (like your 80 cases/day), SLA-driven (24-48 hr resolutions), and tech-heavy (ERP tools automate a lot). India twists add tax layers, but they're straightforward rules once you know the basics. By the end, you'll have the key concepts to confidently discuss in the interview.

#### 1. **Overall Job Overview (What You're Signing Up For)**
   - **Core Focus:** Accounts Payable (AP) is the team's "bill-paying department." You review incoming bills (invoices) from suppliers, check if they're legit, apply taxes/discounts, post them to the system, and release payments. It's part of bigger finance cycles: Record to Report (R2R – closing books monthly) and Order to Cash (O2C – collecting incoming money).
   - **Your Day-to-Day Vibe:** 50-100 invoices/day, resolving queries (like seller emails in your RPSA role), tracking exceptions (like Aged TT reports), and ensuring zero errors (your 100% quality score fits perfectly).
   - **Why It Fits You:** Your payroll processing = invoice validation; EOB audits = invoice audits; Escalations/RCA = query resolutions. Just swap "employee leaves" for "vendor bills."
   - **Shifts/Location:** US nights (e.g., 6 PM-3 AM IST for US day), WFO in Kolkata—mention your global US ops experience to show you're shift-proof.

#### 2. **Key Responsibilities: Explained Step-by-Step**
I'll break it into the JD's buckets (AP, R2R, Cash Apps), with what it means, why it matters, how to do it (high-level), and your transferable skill tie-in.

##### **A. Accounts Payable (Core Invoice Handling – Your Main Gig)**
   This is 70% of the role: Making sure bills are paid right, without fraud or delays.

   - **Review and Process Invoices + Resolutions for Payment:**
     - **What:** Scan supplier bills for accuracy (e.g., amount, date, items match order). Fix issues (e.g., math errors) and "release" for bank payment.
     - **Why:** Prevents overpaying (saves money) and keeps suppliers happy (they get paid fast).
     - **How (Simple Steps):** 1) Receive invoice via email/portal. 2) Validate details (more below). 3) Enter into ERP (like typing payroll data into ADP). 4) Approve/release.
     - **Your Tie-In:** Like reviewing EOBs for 3500+ employees—validate docs, resolve mismatches, ensure payout.
     - **Interview Tip:** "I'd process like my daily 80 payroll cases: Quick scan, flag errors, resolve in SLA."

   - **Basic AP Concepts: 3-Way Match, PO, Non-PO, GRN:**
     - **3-Way Match:** The "triple-check" rule. Compare three docs to approve payment:
       | Document | What It Is | Analogy from Your World |
       |----------|------------|-------------------------|
       | **Purchase Order (PO)** | Supplier's order confirmation (e.g., "Buy 100 laptops for $10k"). | Like a job req in HR—pre-approved spend. |
       | **Goods Receipt Note (GRN)** | Proof delivery happened (e.g., "100 laptops arrived, all good"). | Like attendance log for leave claims—confirms "delivery" of service. |
       | **Invoice** | Supplier's bill (e.g., "$10k due now"). | The actual claim, like an employee's payroll deduction request. |
       - **Match?** If all three agree → Pay. Mismatch (e.g., only 90 laptops arrived)? Hold and query supplier.
     - **PO Invoices:** Bills tied to a PO (most common, 80% of volume).
     - **Non-PO Invoices:** No order needed (e.g., utilities, office snacks)—just validate basics.
     - **GRN:** Delivery slip; ensures no "ghost goods."
     - **Why India Nuances?** Extra checks for imports/local rules (below).
     - **Your Tie-In:** Mirrors your ASIN compliance reviews—match policy (PO), delivery (listing), appeal (invoice).

   - **Experience in Invoice Auditing and Payment Processing:**
     - **What:** Spot fakes/duplicates (audit like your PTO audits); schedule payments (e.g., net-30 days).
     - **How:** Use ERP to flag risks; daily logs for balances.
     - **Your Tie-In:** Your EOB/TT audits for 7000+ employees—same error-hunting.

   - **ERP for Processing (SAP/Navision/Other):**
     - **What:** Software like SAP (big daddy of finance tools) to enter/post invoices. Navision = Microsoft version.
     - **How:** Log in, upload invoice, auto-match, post J/E (journal entry—simple ledger update).
     - **Your Tie-In:** ADP/PeopleSoft for payroll—same data entry/automation. Your SAP cert seals it: "I've trained on SAP essentials; ready for AP modules."

   - **India AP Specifics (The Tax/Import Stuff You Asked About):**
     These are compliance musts for Indian vendors—think of them as US payroll's W-2 rules, but for outgoing payments. Basics only needed; no expert level.

     - **India Import Invoices: Check Bill of Entry + Packing List Before Posting.**
       - **Bill of Entry (BoE):** Customs doc for imported goods (proves duties paid, like a US import tariff form).
       - **Packing List:** Itemized shipment details (weights, quantities).
       - **What/Why:** For import bills, verify these to avoid fake claims or duty fraud. Post only if they match invoice.
       - **How:** Scan for BoE #, customs stamp; reject if missing.
       - **Analogy:** Like verifying safety certs in your RISC role—ensures "product" is legit.

     - **Proficient in Tax Deducted at Source (TDS): % for Major Categories + Foreign Currency Services.**
       - **What is TDS?** India’s "withhold and pay later" tax: Deduct % from supplier payments, remit to govt (like US withholding on freelance pay).
       - **Why:** Govt gets tax upfront; you issue Form 16A certificate to supplier.
       - **Basics – Major Rates (FY 2025-26):** Focus on these for interview (rates unchanged from prior years unless noted; surcharge if high income).
         | Payment Type | TDS Rate | Example |
         |--------------|----------|---------|
         | **Professional/Technical Services** | 10% | Consultant fees (e.g., IT help). |
         | **Contractors/Labor** | 1% (individuals) / 2% (firms) | Construction work. |
         | **Rent (if >₹2.4L/year)** | 10% | Office lease. |
         | **Interest on Loans/FDs** | 10% | Bank interest paid to supplier. |
         | **Commission/Brokerage** | 5-10% | Sales agent fees. |
         - **Foreign Currency Services:** Same rates (e.g., 10% for overseas tech services), but check Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (DTAA) for lower (e.g., 7.5% for some countries). Deduct on INR equivalent.
       - **How in Job:** Calculate TDS on invoice (e.g., ₹100k service → deduct ₹10k TDS, pay supplier ₹90k). Log and file quarterly.
       - **Your Tie-In:** Like US STD/PAR benefits withholding—deduct, remit, audit.
       - **Quick Learn:** Thresholds apply (e.g., no TDS under ₹30k/year for services). Interview: "For a ₹50k consultant invoice, deduct 10% TDS = ₹5k to govt."

     - **GST Basics: Intra-State, Inter-State, Components + Rates.**
       - **What is GST?** Goods & Services Tax—India's VAT-like tax on supplies (replaced old sales tax). Collected on invoice value.
       - **Why:** Ensures tax on every step; you claim Input Tax Credit (ITC) if registered.
       - **Components:**
         | Type | What | When Used |
         |------|------|-----------|
         | **CGST (Central GST)** | Central govt share (e.g., 9%) | Intra-state supplies (within your state). |
         | **SGST (State GST)** | State share (e.g., 9%) | Intra-state (total CGST+SGST=18%). |
         | **IGST (Integrated GST)** | Full rate (e.g., 18%) | Inter-state or imports (central collects, shares with states). |
       - **Intra vs. Inter-State:**
         - **Intra-State:** Seller/buyer in same state → CGST + SGST (e.g., Kolkata to Kolkata).
         - **Inter-State:** Different states → IGST only (e.g., Kolkata to Mumbai).
       - **Rates (Basics for 2025 – Slabs Unchanged, Some Reductions from Sept 22): Know these slabs; specifics by item (e.g., food 5%, luxury 28%).**
         | Slab | Examples | Total GST |
         |------|----------|-----------|
         | **0%** | Essentials (milk, veggies) | Nil. |
         | **5%** | Packed food, transport | Low rate. |
         | **12%** | Mobiles, business services | Mid. |
         | **18%** | Most goods (electronics, consulting) | Standard. |
         | **28%** | Luxury (ACs, cars) + cess | High. |
       - **How in Job:** Verify GST # on invoice, calculate/add (e.g., ₹100k +18% GST=₹118k total). Reject if wrong rate.
       - **Your Tie-In:** Like US sales tax on benefits—add, validate, reconcile.
       - **Quick Learn:** Always check HSN code (item classifier) for rate. Interview: "For inter-state consulting: 18% IGST on ₹100k = ₹18k added."

   - **Resolve Vendor Queries/Requests (Emails/Tickets) Within SLA:**
     - **What:** Answer "Why delayed?" or "Fix duplicate"—like PSAS transfers.
     - **How:** Log in QMS (your SIM/ticketing skills), respond <24 hrs, update tracker.
     - **Your Tie-In:** 60+ escalations—RCA, mitigate.

   - **Validate Invoice Essentials + Maintain Trackers/Exceptions:**
     - **Essentials:** Supplier name, bank details, invoice #/date, PO ref, signatures.
     - **Trackers/Logs:** Excel/daily sheet for holds (e.g., "Invoice #123 on hold—waiting BoE"). Balance end-of-day (debits=credits).
     - **Your Tie-In:** AvP reports, Aged TTs—same tracking.

   - **Follow-Ups, Compliance, Daily Audits:**
     - **Follow-Ups:** Call/email buyers for missing PO/GRN.
     - **Compliance:** Stick to company policy (no bribes, timely TDS filing).
     - **Audits:** Self-check 10% of invoices daily for balances/errors.
     - **Your Tie-In:** Internal reviews, OJT mentoring—enforce like SOPs.

##### **B. Record to Report (R2R) – Month-End Magic (10-20% of Role)**
   - **What:** "Close the books"—finalize monthly finances for reports.
   - **Month-End Closing:** Tally all invoices/payments by 5th; post adjustments.
   - **Reconciliations (Key & Non-Key):** Match records (Key: Bank statements; Non-Key: Supplier ledgers). Fix gaps.
     - **Your Tie-In:** SLA/TTR analyses, EOB pilots.
   - **ERP Tools: SAP/Blackline/HANA Ariba S4, HRC High Radius.**
     - SAP: Core posting. Blackline: Auto-recon. HANA/Ariba: Cloud procurement.
     - **Your Tie-In:** Salesforce/PeopleSoft—adaptable.
   - **Standard/Recurring Journal Entries (J/Es):** Auto-posts like monthly rent accrual (book expense before bill arrives).
     - **Accruals:** "Owe but not paid yet" (e.g., Dec services billed Jan).
     - **Prepaids:** Pay upfront, amortize (e.g., annual insurance).
     - **Deferrals/Leases:** Delay recognition (e.g., lease over 12 months).
   - **Nonstandard J/Es:** One-offs, like corrections.
     - **Your Tie-In:** LOA conversions, stock vesting—accrual-like.

##### **C. Cash Applications/Collections (O2C – Incoming Money Side, 10%)**
   - **Posting Payments from Lockboxes:** Banks send bulk payments (lockbox = PO Box for checks). Match to customer accounts.
   - **Research Aged/Unidentified Cash:** Old/unmatched payments (e.g., "₹50k from XYZ—who?"). Apply correctly.
     - **Your Tie-In:** Unapplied payroll kickouts.
   - **Collections:** Call/email slow-payers for promises (e.g., "Pay by Friday?").
     - **Your Tie-In:** Escalation deep dives.

#### 3. **Qualifications: What They Want (And How You Stack Up)**
